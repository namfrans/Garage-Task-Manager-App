# Garage-Task-Manager-App
#### Valentineâ€™s Garage Scenario
Valentine owns a garage in Windhoek with 13 employees. On daily basis he has
at least one vehicle to repair onsite and on some days some of his employees have to
respond to emergencies where they fix cars at points of breakdown and maybe along
the road. In most cases he assigns his experienced employees to attend problems
offsite or he goes himself as call-in services are more rewarding than working onsite.
However, in most cases when he is on call he hears complains from customers whereby
some tasks were omitted that are supposed to be routinely carried out when servicing
or repairing a car. The problem is so severe to the extent some of employees forgot to
tighten the wheels on one truck they were working on. Each time Valentine tries to
investigate a case, his employees would play a blame game whereby each one would
have expected it to be done by another employee. To solve this problem, Valentine
requested a system that sees him out of this problem. Below are some of the key
requirements:

- Valentine or senior staff should be able to add a job, that is, car details that
have to be worked on;

- Upon finishing a task from a checklist, an employee who worked on a task
should mark it as done and add additional comments if available. This allows
Valentine to track tasks done by individuals and also ensures that all tasks were
done before a vehicle leaves their garage;

- Valentine should also be able to assign tasks on a job when he is away.

- Generate reports of tasks done by individual employees on a daily or monthly
basis.
